# Prelaunch Sign Up Page

This is done with only HTML5, CSS and Javascript.  Currently there is no backend code.  The file index.js
could be modified to make an AJAX call to store the email address and referal URL in a database.  Also
to modify the referal URL, change the variable "url" in index.js.  This mockup is based on 
https://www.evasioapp.com, but without using the Nette php library.
